//    Time Complexity:
//    O(N) { Since the function is being called n times, and for each function, we have only one printable line that takes O(1) time, so the cumulative time complexity would be O(N) }

//
//    Space Complexity:
//    O(N) { In the worst case, the recursion stack space would be full with all the function calls waiting to get completed and that would make it an O(N) recursion stack space }.
